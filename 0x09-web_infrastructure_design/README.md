# Web Infrastructure Design


This project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of web infrastructure design. It involves designing a web infrastructure that is scalable, reliable, and secure. The project is part of the curriculum for becoming a DevOps engineer and helps in building a solid foundation in web infrastructure concepts.

## Objectives

- Understand the basics of web infrastructure
- Design a scalable and reliable web infrastructure
- Implement security best practices
- Document the infrastructure design

## Project Structure

1. **Diagram 1: Simple Web Infrastructure**
    - A single server hosting a web application and a database.
    - No redundancy or load balancing.
    - Example: A typical LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

2. **Diagram 2: Distributed Web Infrastructure**
    - Multiple servers for load balancing and redundancy.
    - Separate servers for web and database tiers.
    - Use of a Load Balancer to distribute traffic.
    - Example: Nginx as a load balancer, multiple web servers, and a separate database server.

3. **Diagram 3: Secure and Scalable Web Infrastructure**
    - Incorporates firewalls, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS for security.
    - Auto-scaling groups for handling traffic spikes.
    - Use of CDN (Content Delivery Network) for faster content delivery.
    - Example: AWS infrastructure using EC2 instances, RDS, CloudFront, and Elastic Load Balancing.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Diagramming Tools**: Use tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or any other diagramming software to create infrastructure diagrams.
- **Web Servers**: Nginx
- **Database Servers**: MySQL
- **Load Balancers**: Nginx
- **Security**: Firewalls, SSL/TLS, HTTPS
