# Postmortem


### Issue Summary:
**Duration:** June 1, 2023, 08:00 AM - 11:30 AM (UTC)
**Impact:** The web application experienced a complete outage, making it inaccessible to all users. During this time, users encountered error messages and were unable to access any features or content.

### Timeline:
- **08:00 AM:** The monitoring system triggered an alert for a high volume of server errors, signaling the issue.
- **08:05 AM:** The on-call engineering team was notified.
- **08:10 AM:** Initial investigations began to determine the root cause.
- **09:00 AM:** The team ruled out database and server infrastructure issues.
- **09:30 AM:** Efforts shifted to debugging the application code and external API integrations.
- **10:30 AM:** The team identified and investigated several potential causes, including recent code deployments and third-party service disruptions.
- **11:00 AM:** The incident was escalated to the senior engineering team.
- **11:30 AM:** The issue was resolved by rolling back a recent code change that caused a misconfigured API integration.

### Root Cause and Resolution:
The outage was traced to a recent code change that introduced a misconfiguration in an API integration, causing an error loop in the application code. This resulted in a cascading failure that prevented the application from serving requests. The engineering team identified the problematic code change and quickly reverted it, restoring normal functionality.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improve Code Review Process:** Enhance the code review process to ensure thorough examination of critical integrations and prevent misconfigurations from being deployed.
- **Enhance Testing and Quality Assurance:** Implement comprehensive testing, including integration testing and QA checks, to catch potential issues before they reach production. This includes thorough tests of API integrations.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Upgrade the monitoring system to provide more detailed and actionable alerts, including checks for API integration health, error rates, and response times.
- **Incident Response Documentation:** Document the incident and resolution in a centralized knowledge base for future reference, aiding faster troubleshooting and resolution in similar situations.

### Tasks to Address the Issue:
- Conduct a thorough review of all API integrations and configurations to ensure their correctness and compatibility with the application.
- Strengthen the testing infrastructure by expanding the automated test suite, focusing on API integrations.
- Enhance the monitoring system to include specific checks for API integration health and response times.
- Schedule regular incident response training and drills to improve the team's readiness in handling critical incidents.

### Conclusion:
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in an API integration, which was quickly resolved by reverting a recent code change. Moving forward, the recommended corrective and preventative measures will be implemented to prevent similar incidents and enhance the web application's resilience and stability.
